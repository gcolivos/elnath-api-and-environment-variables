# Giphy API

Today you will revisit the Giphy API and use Angular's `$http` service to create a fun application.

You'll need to read through the [Giphy documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/) to determine which endpoints you need to complete this app.

You will also need to register an account in order to get your `API Key`. This key is used for all of your requests to authenticate your app to Giphy.

## TODO

### MVP

Start by putting your `$http` request in the controller. After you get everything working, try moving the request into a service. 

- Allow users to get a random giphy by clicking a *RANDOM* button. Results should be displayed on the DOM.
- Users should also be able to search for a giphy using a keyword. Results should be displayed on the DOM.

### Stretch Goals

- Previous and next buttons for search results (using the Giphy API for pagination).
- Once all the functionality is complete, do some styling with Bootstrap.
